Control your Kasa TP-Link smart switches from your Windows 10 device.

This is a .NET program to control Kasa TP-Link smart switches from your Windows 10 device. 

I also have a Python-QT version that works on Windows/Mac OS X/Linux but it's not as modern: https://github.com/clorteau/kasa.

To install this Windows 10 version just get it from the Windows Store.
